# Using the Cassava Leaf Disease Dataset for Agricultural AI

This guide provides practical insights and methodologies for utilizing the Cassava Leaf Disease dataset in agricultural AI and data science applications.

## 1. Data Preparation and Preprocessing

### Image Preprocessing
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

def preprocess_image(image_path, target_size=(224, 224)):
    """
    Preprocess images for model input
    """
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    img = img.resize(target_size)
    img = np.array(img) / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values
    return img
```

### Data Augmentation
```python
data_augmentation = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.RandomFlip("horizontal"),
    tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation(0.2),
    tf.keras.layers.RandomZoom(0.2),
    tf.keras.layers.RandomBrightness(0.2),
])
```

## 2. Model Development Approaches

### 2.1 Transfer Learning
Utilize pre-trained models for better performance:
```python
base_model = tf.keras.applications.EfficientNetB0(
    include_top=False,
    weights='imagenet',
    input_shape=(224, 224, 3)
)
```

### 2.2 Custom CNN Architecture
```python
def create_custom_model():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(),
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax')
    ])
    return model
```
